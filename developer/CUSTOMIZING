Various hard-coded configuration options are set in on_config.h.


To add a new command, take these steps:

1. Add an entry to initCommands[] in on_commands.c similar to the other commands. Follow the declarations of Command in on_commands.h and CommandExample in on_examples.h.

2. Increment NCOMMANDS in commands.h

3. Declare the new command in on_function.h of the form "FunctionValue functionName(FunctionValue arg);"

4. Add a definition for "functionName" somewhere, e.g. in on_functions.c.

8. Compile, then test the full and short versions of the command and test the example.
